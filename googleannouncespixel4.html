            Today Google has announced the Google Pixel 4 and 4 XL after months of leaks, rumors, and speculation (but mostly leaks). Standout features include a new 90hz capable display, Face Unlock, Motion Sense using a new radar chip integrated into the top bezel of the display, a new audio recording app called Recorder with live transcription, and a new telephoto lens to accompany the wide lens that Pixel users have become accustomed to. Both phones are available to preorder today with the official release date being October 24th on all major US carriers. The 4 will start at $799 (64GB) while the 4 XL will start at $899 (64GB), upgrades to 128GB of storage on both models will be $100.
            The two phones sport a new design featuring a single-tone back as opposed to the two-tone of past Pixels, a notch-less 90hz capable display (5.7-inch on 4 and 6.3-inch on 4 XL), a new camera square which houses a new telephoto sensor, and a lack of front facing speakers. Each phone has essentially the same design, save for their size, which hasn’t occurred in the flagship Pixel line since the original Google Pixel. They come in three colors, Just Black, Clearly White, and a limited edition Oh So Orange.

        <p>
            While the tech specs can tell a lot of the story, it doesn’t tell all of it. The smaller Pixel 4’s battery has been a concern and point of critique for many, but to truly see if it’s a problem we’ll have to test it ourselves. We look forward to testing these phones out, so stay tuned for our full review coming early next week.
