            Apple just announced the iPhone 11, 11 Pro, and 11 Pro Max and while most have focused on the naming issue that is the iPhone 11 Pro Max, I’ve noticed something that could be considered even more concerning: the iPhone 11. Apple has been praised over the past two days for making the lower end iPhone the new “standard”. While I believe this is a good move in the long run, Apple has put its customers in a confusing situation.

            Let’s take a look back at iPhone names. In the past, the way the iPhones were named consisted of a number one year, followed by that number with an “S” the next year and then the next number the year after that, with some exceptions. This is seen from the iPhone 3G up until the iPhone 7. In 2017, Apple announced the iPhone 8, 8 Plus, and iPhone X. The iPhone X introduced a new premium tier for the iPhone, as well as a vision for the future. This is where the problems begin.

            Apple’s 2017 lineup wasn’t necessarily the problem itself, but it started it. The iPhone X was framed as a premium option and that was fine, it was easy for consumers to understand. The premium option was there but the standard iPhone offerings were still available. In 2018, Apple introduced the iPhone XS, XS Max, and XR. This took the previous year and flipped it on its head, the lower end model was now the budget option, and the premium models were the new standard donning the “S” classification.

            This year, Apple took their naming convention from last year and flipped it around. The XR outsold the XS by a fairly large margin, which could’ve led Apple to where the iPhone naming situation is now. The iPhone 11 is the successor to the iPhone XR in every aspect but the name. The iPhone 11 Pro is a successor to the iPhone XS in every aspect but the name. In the eyes of an average consumer, the iPhone 11 Pro is a new tier of iPhone, and the iPhone 11 is the successor to the iPhone XS because that’s how the names have always worked. 
        </P>
        <p>
             I’ve seen this misconception among my peers and around social media. Many have expressed their desire to “upgrade” to the iPhone 11 from an iPhone XS, when in reality it would be a downgrade in many ways. At the end of the day, Apple is still selling a new phone, but this change in naming has already had unintended consequences for its customers.
